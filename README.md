# polybar-dwm-config - My polybar config used with my build of dwm and polybar-dwm-module

Config based on [@adi1090x](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes) theme polybar-13, modified to use
a single bar and dwm module with [polybar-dwm-module](https://github.com/mihirlad55/polybar-dwm-module).

Used with [my build of dwm](https://github.com/bullekeup/dwm), along with my [dwm startup and config scripts](https://github.com/bullekeup/dwm-config).

Font + icons : MesloLGS Nerd Font
